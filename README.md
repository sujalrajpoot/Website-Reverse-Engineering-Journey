# Website Reverse Engineering Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Website Reverse Engineering journey! This repository documents my explorations, learning process, and progress in understanding how websites function behind the scenes. I'll be dissecting, analyzing, and sometimes replicating web features to deepen my knowledge of web technologies, security practices, and application behavior.

## 📚 About This Project

This project is an ongoing log of my journey in reverse engineering websites. My aim is to:
- Understand website architecture and data flow.
- Explore how websites handle client-server interactions.
- Learn about security mechanisms and common vulnerabilities.
- Recreate various web functionalities to enhance my skills as a web developer.

## 🌟 Skills and Tools

Throughout this journey, I’ll be using a range of skills and tools, including but not limited to:

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Node.js
- **Tools**: 
  - **HTTP Clients**: `requests` library in Python, Postman
  - **Proxy Tools**: Burp Suite, Fiddler
  - **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspecting network requests, analyzing source code, and debugging scripts
- **Other**: Web scraping and automation using `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and related libraries

## 🔍 Current Focus

I’m currently focusing on the following areas:

1. **HTTP Protocol and Client-Server Interactions**: Understanding how requests and responses work, analyzing headers, cookies, and session management.
2. **Web Scraping and Automation**: Using Python tools to extract data and simulate user interactions.
3. **Frontend-Backend Analysis**: Gaining insights into frontend frameworks and backend API structures.
